I'm a Machine Learning Engineer.

At [Expedia Group](https://expediagroup.com/), I work in the Revenue Optimisation team. 

My work in the team has spanned designing and deploying high-performance machine learning models, building robust data architectures to process petabyte-scale datasets, and delivering real-time systems capable of serving billions of requests with millisecond latency — all within the realms of pricing, recommendation, and fraud detection. I enjoy owning projects from the initial proof-of-concept all the way to production monitoring.

Throughout my journey, I’ve been fortunate to learn from numerous mentors who have shaped not only my technical abilities but also my way of thinking. I hope to share what I've learned with others. 

Feel free to browse [my blog posts]({{ '/thinking/' | relative_url }}) to learn more.
